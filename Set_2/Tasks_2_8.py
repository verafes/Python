# Task 2.71. Filter the number
https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b051fac50a3292a9000025/
# Your task is to return a number from a string.
# Details: You will be given a string of numbers and letters mixed up, 
# you have to return all the numbers in that string in the order they occur.

# Task 2.72. Simple Pig Latin
https://www.codewars.com/kata/520b9d2ad5c005041100000f
# Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.
# Examples
# pig_it('Pig latin is cool') # igPay atinlay siay oolcay
# pig_it('Hello world !')     # elloHay orldway !

# Task 2.73. Love vs friendship

# Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26
# Then l + o + v + e = 54

# So friendship is twice stronger than love :-)

# Task 2.74. filterEvenLengthWords
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59564f3bcc15b5591a00004a
# Write a function called "filterEvenLengthWords".
# Given an array of strings, "filterEvenLengthWords" returns an array containing only the elements of the given array whose length is an even number.
# var output = filterEvenLengthWords(['word', 'words', 'word', 'words']);

# Task 2.75. Can Santa save Christmas?
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5857e8bb9948644aa1000246
# Oh no! Santa's little elves are sick this year. He has to distribute the presents on his own.
# But he has only 24 hours left. Can he do it?
# Your Task:
# You will get an array as input with time durations as string in the following format: HH:MM:SS. 
# Each duration is a present Santa has to distribute. Determine whether he can do it in 24 hours or not.

# Task 76. 2.Sum even numbers
https://www.codewars.com/kata/586beb5ba44cfc44ed0006c3
# Write a function named sumEvenNumbers, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. 
# Your function must return the sum of the even values of this sequence.
# Only numbers without decimals like 4 or 4.0 can be even.
# Input: # sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.
# For example, considering this input value : [4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8], 
# then your function should return 30 (because 4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30).

# Task 77. 2.Invert values
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5899dc03bc95b1bf1b0000ad
# Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.
# invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
# invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
# invert([]) == []
# You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

# Task 2.78. If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077
# Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur:

# Task 2.79. Draw stairs
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b4e779c578c6a898e0005c5
# Given a number n, draw stairs using the letter "I", n tall and n wide, with the tallest in the top left.
# For example n = 3 result in:

# Task 2.80. Interview Question (easy)
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b358a1e228d316283001892
# You receive the name of a city as a string, and you need to return a string that shows how many times 
# each letter shows up in the string by using an asterisk (*).
# For example:
# "Chicago"  -->  "c:**,h:*,i:*,a:*,g:*,o:*"
# As you can see, the letter c is shown only once, but with 2 asterisks.# 
# The return string should include only the letters (not the dashes, spaces, apostrophes, etc). 
# There should be no spaces in the output, and the different letters are separated by a comma (,) 
# as seen in the example above.
# Note that the return string must list the letters in order of their first appearence in the original string.
